W-Br: Welcome to the annual investors' meeting of Prestor Clothing Manufacturers. We invited you here today to present our vision for the next stage of growth for the company. Recently, demand levels have surpassed our production capabilities. For instance, you all know our most popular line of blue jeans. Well, there's currently a three-month back order. So that we don't lose sales, we're asking for an increase in your financial support. That money would be used to purchase new manufacturing equipment. A little later we'll have a tour of the factory floor. At the end of the tour, our General Manager will give a short presentation about the specific equipment changes we're proposing.
