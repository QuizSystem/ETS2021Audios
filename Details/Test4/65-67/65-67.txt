65-67

M-Au: As you know, our sales here at Newton Electronics dropped ten percent from last year. We need to make our products more attractive to consumers.
W-Br: Well, I created this chart to list the features we at Newton Electronics offer compared to what our top competitor offers. Maybe it can help us figure out a new strategy.
M-Au: Hmm... I see that we provide a feature that Technology Brothers doesn't. I think we should focus on promoting that.
W-Br: That's a good idea. I'll contact our marketing team and have them start working on a new series of advertisements right away.
