M-Cn Hi, Azusa. Do you have a minute?
W-Br Sure, what is it?
M-Cn Well, I was wondering if I could switch offices.

M-Cn Pierre was transferred to the Lakeville branch months ago and his former office is a lot bigger than mine. It’d be better for hosting clients.
W-Br That makes sense. Submit the request on our internal Web site, and our administrative team will process it when they can.
M-Cn Thanks! I’ll do that now.
