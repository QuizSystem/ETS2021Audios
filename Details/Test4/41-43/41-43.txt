41-43

M-Cn: Hi, I live in apartment 3B, and I'm calling about the kitchen sink. It started leaking yesterday. I'd like to put in a service request to have it fixed.
W-Br: OK, Stefan can fix that - he can be at your place within an hour. Does that work with your schedule?
M-Cn: I guess I could wait for him to come. I didn't realize I had to be here during the repair.
W-Br: Yes, you do - it's the apartment complex's policy that all maintenance work has to be done while the tenant is present. Plus, that way you'll be able to show Stefan exactly what the problem is.
