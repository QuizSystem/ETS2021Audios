35-37

M-Au This is the information desk, right?
W-Am Yes – do you need help finding your train platform?
M-Au No, my train doesn’t leave for another five hours. I was wondering if there are lockers in the station where I could store my luggage. I’d like to visit some tourist sites while I’m here, but my suitcase is really heavy. I don’t want to bring it along.
W-Am Unfortunately, we don’t offer that service. But the hotel across the street will keep your luggage in a secure room. They charge five dollars per hour, though.
M-Au That sounds perfect. You said the hotel is right across the street?
W-Am Yes-just go through those doors.
