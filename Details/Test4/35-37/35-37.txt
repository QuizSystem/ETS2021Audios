M-Cn: Let me introduce you to Dmitry, one of our featured potters this month. If you're interested, he could make something for your colleague.
M-Au: Hi, I'm Dmitry. I have a catalog here with some examples of my work.
W-Br: That'd be great. I'll take a look. And I'll be sure to tell her that the gift was custom-made!
