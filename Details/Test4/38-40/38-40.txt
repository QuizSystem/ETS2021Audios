W-Br: Takumi, I'm planning to attend the company health fair on Monday. Would you be interested in going together?
M-Au: Oh, I'm on vacation next week. I did go last year - it was really great. I learned some exercises and stretches that are helpful for office workers like us. I still do them every day.
W-Br: Oh - hopefully they'll have that presentation again... My back often aches after sitting at my desk all day. It would be nice to learn some techniques to make my back feel better.
