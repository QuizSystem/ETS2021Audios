W-Br: Hi, Ravi. Our customers have become more environmentally conscious... and they really don't like that we put our beverages in plastic bottles. We should consider switching to glass soda bottles instead.
M-Au: Hmm... we would need to purchase all new machinery, and that's a big investment.
W-Br: Right. We would need new machinery, but now that our soda brand's become so popular, I think we might be able to afford it.
M-Au: That’s true. We should bring it up to the management team.
W-Br: I'll put together a proposal. I’ll need a few days to do it though.
