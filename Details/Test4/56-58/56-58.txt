56-58

W-Am Samir and Alexi, Iwanted to talk to you about the construction trade show… What do you think about skipping it this year?
M-Cn But we’ve had a booth at that trade show every year for the past five years – isn’t it a good way for the construction firm to get new business?
W-Am Well, at last year’s trade show, our sales team collected contact information from eighty potential clients, but we didn’t sign contracts with any of them.
M-Au There are other benefits to going. Since we hired a new architect last month, it would be a good opportunity for people to become familiar with her projects.
W-Cn I agree-her architectural designs are a great selling point.
