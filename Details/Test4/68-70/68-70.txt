W-Am Oh, hello Duncan. Is that the new coffee maker for our office break room?
M-Cn Yes, it is. This model uses a lot less energy. With all the coffee we drink, we’ll save money on electricity.
W-Am That model looks bigger than I expected-much bigger than the old one. I’m worried there won’t be enough counter space for it. Are you going to put it next to the refrigerator?
M-Cn No, I think there’s more space next to the microwave-let’s put it there instead.
