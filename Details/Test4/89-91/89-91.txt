W-Am: Good afternoon. First on the agenda is our process for communicating repair requests to you. In the past, tenants in the apartment building called our office to report maintenance problems, and then we called one of you to make the repair. Now, tenants will be able to report any maintenance problem using a mobile application. Then, if you're the person on duty, you'll receive a message from the app with the apartment number, contact number , and description of the problem or needed repair. I'm just waiting for management to approve my suggested timeline for this process. Once I have that, we'll implement the change.
