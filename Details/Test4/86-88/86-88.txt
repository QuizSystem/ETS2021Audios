M-Au: Hello, everyone. I'm Sanjeev Yadav from Colby Tech Services. Your head librarian, Ms. Wilson, invited me here to speak with you. As you know, the library is converting its older books and journals to digital formal to preserve them for future use. I'll be showing you how to scan the materials to store them electronically. We'll be using a scanner with a V-shaped cradle, which allows us to digitize a book without having to open it fully so it doesn't get damaged. Now... I believe you'll only be working on the historical archive collection today, but you should speak with Ms. Wilson. OK, please watch while I demonstrate the process.
