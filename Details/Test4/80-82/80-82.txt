W-Am: Hello, Ms. Yamada. This is Maryam from Slate Vacation Rentals. I'm calling about the beach house that you reserved for the week of March twenty-ninth. I apologize, but we've realized that there was an error in our booking system. The beach house isn't available at that time. Instead, I'd like to put you in another house, even closer to the beach. Take a look at the pictures I've sent you by e-mail. This place in more expensive, but we'd rent it to you for the same price as your original booking. Now, I'm currently holding this property open for you, but it is very popular. As always, you can reach me at my office number.
