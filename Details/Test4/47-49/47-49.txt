W-Am Hiroshi, now that you’ve had a tour of the factory, you’re ready to start training.
M-Au Great! I had no idea how complicated candy making is!
W-Am Anya here is going to be your trainer today. She’s going to show you how to run a quality control test on the candy syrup.
W-Br Hiroshi, nice to meet you. We always begin by emphasizing the importance of cleanliness while completing quality control tests. For that reason, I’d like you to put on these rubber gloves.
M-Au Of course. Thank you.
