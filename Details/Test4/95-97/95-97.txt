M-Au: Hello, Ms. Lee. This is Alexander Burrows calling from Firsthand Report News. I'm calling about our interview to discuss your new book. We're scheduled to meet tomorrow morning at nine o'clock at Kondo's Café. Well, I just passed the café, and I să a sign in the window saying that it doesn't open until ten o'clock. I'm afraid we'll need to find another place to meet. Please call me back at 555-0152, so we can arrange a new meeting location. And thank you for agreeing to this interview!
