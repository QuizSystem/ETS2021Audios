M-Au: Good morning, everyone. I called this staff meeting because there's going to be a film festival in town at the beginning of next month, and over 5,000 people, including many actors and actresses, will be attending it. Since the hotel is so close to the convention center, all of our standard rooms and suites have already been booked. This is great for business, but it does mean there'll be more work for us to do than usual. So if you could work extra hours during the dates of the festival, I'd really appreciate it.
