92-94

M-Cn: Hello, everyone. I just spoke with management and they confirmed that there will be a reduction in company spending for the next quarter. So we can't replace all of the equipment that we'd hoped to. That means we need to make some choices. Well, you know... We have had the computers on the first floor for a very long time. But what do you think? Send me an e-mail with your recommendations by the end of the day. I planned to make the final decision this afternoon, but I need to travel to New York for an important meeting. I'll decide tomorrow.
