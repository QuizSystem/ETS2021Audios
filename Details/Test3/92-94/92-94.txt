92-94

W-Am: The next agenda item in today's employee orientation is to show you the protocols for how to deal with our company's classified materials. You're joining our patent law firm, and we have a responsibility to protect our legal clients' proprietary information. Everyone who works here needs to be trained on the security procedures. In a few minutes, I'll begin by explaining specifically what kinds of information we need to keep private, and then I'll show you the methods used to secure that data. But before we begin, we've already covered a lot of topics about working here, and I think we could all use a short break. Please be back in the room in ten minutes.
