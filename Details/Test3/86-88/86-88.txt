86-88

M-Au: Good morning. We're glad you could all make it to the National Home Appliances Trade Show. In our exhibit, KLT Appliances is proud to introduce an exciting product for you to carry in your stores. Our Ultra Wash model is the first washing machine to feature two separate washing compartments for different types of fabrics, so customers can do two loads of laundry at once. This will be appealing to customers, since it means they won't have to spend as much time returning to the washer to reload it. Currently, this model comes in silver; however, soon a greater variety of color choices will be available.
