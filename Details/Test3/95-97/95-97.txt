95-97

M-Au: Hi, Linda. It's Joseph. I just got a call from a potential client. They're looking for a new paper supplier and might be interested in doing business with us. I invited their two managers out to dinner tomorrow to discuss the possibility of using us as their paper supplier. There's a restaurant near the office that has a four-star rating, so I made us a reservation there. This client would be very important for us, so I think we should go over our sales presentation before the dinner. Can we meet tomorrow morning at ten to practice?
