95-97

M-Cn: Hi, Paul. This is Hans Schmidt at Jayline Clothing. I'm going over the advertising campaign your firm is doing for our new line of women's casual clothing, and I have some questions about the budget. I want to see if there's a way to bring down the cost of the campaign. Would you be available to meet tomorrow afternoon at one o'clock? My schedule just changed, and that would be the best time for me to discuss this with you. Let me know if that'll work for you.
