W-Br: Attention, Wilmington train station passengers. Starting next week, the train station will be undergoing renovation to its first floor. These renovations will provide many benefits. Two clothing stores, a cafÃ©, and an electronics store have already made plans to open at the station. During the renovation project, we strongly recommend that you buy train tickets online because there will be fewer ticket windows open. Tickets can be purchased on our Web site.
