M-Au Hi, Mei Na. I’m calling to update you on William Thompson, the new math teacher we just hired.
W-Br Right-he’ll be teaching our online classes. We agreed to wire his first paycheck in advance, right?
M-Au Yeah, so he can upgrade his computer before the job starts. And that’s what I wanted to talk to you about.
W-Br OK.
M-Au The wire transfer was supposed to be made on Friday, but there was a problem.
W-Br What’s that?
M-Au Accounting was given the wrong information for his bank. We had the name of the bank spelled wrong. We corrected it, but not in time to make the transfer until this morning.
