77-79

M-Au: Can I please have the attention of all Winthrop factory employees? The heavy rain last night caused a leak in the roof over the staff cafeteria. The cafeteria will therefore be unavailable until further notice. You might want to go to one of the sandwich shops on Dunlop Street, which is nearby. To allow for this, all factory employees will have an extra half hour for lunch for the time being. Thank you.
