W-Am: Hi, Satoshi. I'm at the farm picking up fruits and vegetables for the dinner we're catering tomorrow night. The shopping list indicates one basket of apples, but I'm not sure which kind to get.
M-Au: Well, we're planning to make apple pies, so Golden Rich would be best for baking.
W-Am: OK, good. They have those. Is there anything else you need me to do before I come back there?
M-Au: Yes, I ordered some new business cards to advertise our catering services. Could you stop by the printing company and pick those up?
W-Am: Sure. It's on my way. See you soon.
