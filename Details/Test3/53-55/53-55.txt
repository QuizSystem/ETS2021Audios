W-Am: Hello, Springvale Zoo.
M-Au: Hi, I'm having my daughter's birthday party at your zoo next Saturday. I've reserved the party room, but I wondered if there's a limit to the number of guests I can invite to join us in the room.
W-Am: Actually, yes, there's a limit of 25 guests in the party room.
M-Au: Oh, that should be fine, thanks. Also, I heard an interview with the director of your zoo on the radio. She mentioned that you give presentations about different animals.
W-Am: Yes, we have an animal education program. For an extra fee, one of our zoologists can give a talk about our endangered animals before the children visit the zoo.
