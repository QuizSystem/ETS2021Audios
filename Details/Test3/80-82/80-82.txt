W-Br: Hey, Vladimir. It's Eva. I just met him Martin from new product development. He really likes the work we've done on the new video game. He's asked us to present the game at the trade show in San Francisco next weekend. Let me know if you're able to go. I can get train tickets. Also, umm, Martin didn't think there was much for us to prepare in advance, but... I don't know about that. I'm free tomorrow afternoon. Let me know.
