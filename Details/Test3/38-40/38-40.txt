W-Br: Taro, can I have a word with you? One of your employees, Dan Howell, visited me in Human Resources today to let me know he'd be leaving his position as Training Coordinator.
M-Au: Oh, yes, Dan. He'll be retiring in six months. I'm glad he gave you advance notice.
W-Br: I am, too. However, I wanted to ask if you'd like me to look into hiring a new employee to replace him.
M-Au: You know, our current staff is pretty well trained at the moment. Dan's sessions have been very effective. So, for the time being, we won't need to replace him.
