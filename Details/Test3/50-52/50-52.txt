W-Br: Good morning, Tushar. Have you seen the marketing report for our furniture business?
M-Cn: Not yet. How do the data look? Did we get a profile of who's shopping at our stores?
W-Br: Yes. Clearly, we're really popular with older adults, but younger shoppers are going somewhere else.
M-Cn: I think improving the online shopping experience with a better Web site would appeal more to a younger demographic.
W-Br: That's a good idea, but we might need to bring in an outside consultant for a short-term project like that.
