W-Br: Thanks for listening to KCLG, your favorite station for local news and weather! Things are looking warmer over the coming days, and fortunately, the warmest day of the week will coincide with the grand opening of the Stonecreek Trails. The parks department has been working hard to convert the abandoned railroad tracks to hiking and biking paths for the local community. This is just the first phase of a larger project, and donations are needed to help extend the trails another ten miles. Donate to the project today through our Web site at www.kclgradio.org.
