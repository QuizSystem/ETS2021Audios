98-100

W-Br: Good morning. I'm Marissa from Yardley Consultants. Our firm consults with local companies to help them increase their business. I'll work here for the next two days to help you find ways to expand your business. I did some market research about tourism in this area and compiled the data into this chart. I found out that tourists are interested in visiting places that are already on your tours, like the state park. But, look... fourteen percent of the people surveyed mentioned a site that isn't included in any of your tour packages! So now, please send a few minutes brainstorming with the person next to you about ways your tour offerings could be revised.
