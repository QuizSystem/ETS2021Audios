89-91

W-Br: Thanks, everyone, for attending today's meeting. I'd like to share with you the results of our guest satisfaction survey. The survey gave us useful information about which personal care products we should provide for guests in our hotel rooms. The results show that only ten percent of our guests used the shower caps we've been providing, so we're not going to supply them anymore. However, our shampoo seems to be well liked by our guests, so we'll keep stocking that. Please remember to place the shampoo bottles right on the bathroom counter, not in the cabinet, since some guests complained about having difficulty finding them.
