M-Cn: Welcome, everyone, to our annual corporate retreat. We've planned a number of team-building activities to give you a chance to get to know your colleagues better. For this reason, we request that you turn off your mobile devices for the next 48 hours. Before we begin our first activity, we'd like you all to be familiar with the area and everything that is available here. Hassan, the hotel manager, has agreed to show you around the grounds.
