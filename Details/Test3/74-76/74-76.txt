74-76

W-Am: Thanks, everyone, for attending today's planning meeting. Now that there's a date set for the music festival we can start inviting bands to perform. Also... last year we held the festival at Edmond Hall, and that worked well for the number of people who attended. But, this event gets more popular every year. So we can discuss some alternatives in next week's meeting. Today, I want to show you the final version of this year's festival logo. I think this design'll look great in the advertisements and on merchandise.
