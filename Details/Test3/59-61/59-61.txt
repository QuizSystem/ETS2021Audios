W-Am: Now on Radio Twelve, we're talking with Wayfield Technologies CEO, Omar Rashad. Welcome!
M-Cn: Thanks for having me.
W-Am: Absolutely. Let's talk about Wayfield's recent announcement. Your company is known for producing powerful laptop computers. But now you'll be making mobile phones?
M-Cn: Yes, we've been specializing in laptops for quite some time and decided to put that same technology into mobile devices.
W-Am: Who's the target demographic?
M-Cn We think that people who travel frequently for work will be interested in this phone, since it comes loaded with business-related applications. In fact, a group of our salespeople will be at the Toronto airport on Tuesday, giving a product demonstration. Perhaps you'd like to come by.
