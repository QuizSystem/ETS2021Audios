W-Br: Hi, Gerard. Just a reminder, all proposals for this year's technology conference have to be submitted by tomorrow.
M-Cn: Yes, I know. I actually finished my proposal earlier today, but I haven't been able to upload it yet... I think the Web site's down for maintenance.
W-Br: Oh, I had the same problem - the Web site's really busy. You just have to keep trying.
M-Cn: In that case, I think I'll go to lunch first and try again when I get back. Would you like to join me?
W-Br: Sure - let's go now.
