95-97

M-Cn: Good job, everyone. Today's end-of-season sale was a huge success, and you all did a good job assisting customers. We're almost completely sold-out of winter accessories. There are only a few gloves and scarves left, and coats are selling well. This is great because we're expecting the first shipment of spring clothes next Tuesday. We really need to clear out as much space on our shelves as possible. There's been one change to tomorrow's schedule - Patrick will be out, so I'll be filling in for him myself.
