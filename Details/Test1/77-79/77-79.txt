W-Am: To begin today's staff meeting, I'm happy to announce that our plans to create an outdoor work area have been finalized. When the project is completed, there'll be individual workstations and tables for small group meetings. If you want to see what the space will look like, there's an architectural layout posted on our company's home page. Be sure to let us know if you have any questions or concerns. Some of you have already expressed concern about accessing the Internet outside. I can assure you... wireless Internet connectivity will be available.
