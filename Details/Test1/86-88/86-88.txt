M-Au: I'd like to welcome Mei Wang, the new staff writer for the arts and culture section of our magazine. For the past five years, Ms. Wang was the lead reporter for the local newspaper in her hometown. Even though she wrote for a small newspaper, I think you might recognize her name. In January, she won a prestigious national award for her news story about community theaters in small towns. I'm sure you all are eager to get to know Ms. Wang better. So, we'll be holding a luncheon for her today, and everyone is invited. Please stop by the conference room at noon for soup and sandwiches.
