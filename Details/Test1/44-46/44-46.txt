W-Br: Hi, Carlos. Did you see the e-mail from the manager? Out fitness center's going to stay open 24 hours.
M-Au: Yes, I read it. The e-mail said the new hours will start next month. I think it'll make our members very happy. They've wanted later hours for a while.
W-Br: Definitely. The manager also asked us to make some signs and post them around the gym so members are aware of this change.
M-Au: I have some time now. I'll get started making those signs right away.
