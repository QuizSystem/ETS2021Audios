M-Cn: Adam, I just got a message to come to the factory floor. Is something wrong?
M-Au: There's a problem with the last few desks that came off the production line. Look at this one - the top surface of the desk is loose because no glue was applied from the machines.
M-Cn: Carol - could you join us for a minute? Can you check the glue machines on your team's part of the assembly line? They probably need a refill.
W-Am: OK. I'll shut them down and take a look. We should be back in service within an hour.
M-Cn: Good. This afternoon at one o'clock, some prospective clients will be visiting. Everything needs to be running smoothly by then.
