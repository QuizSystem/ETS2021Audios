W-Cn: Welcome to Pavilion Appliance Store. How can I help you?
W-Am: Well, the handle on the door of my refrigerator broke off.
W-Cn: Oh, that's not good. If you bough it more than a year ago, it's not going to be covered by the warranty.
W-Am: I know - I bought it three years ago. But I can fix it myself... I just need to buy the handle.
M-Cn: I'm sorry, but we don't sell replacement parts.
W-Am: So, do you know of a store that does sell them?
W-Cn: Well, there is a Web site that sells appliance parts at good prices. You could see if they have what you're looking for. It's called AppliancePartsForyou.com.
