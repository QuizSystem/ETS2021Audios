M-Au: Hi. I'm calling about your online leadership course. According to your Web site, it's one of three courses required for your Professional Certificate in Management. I'm not interested in the certificate, so can I just take the leadership course?
W-Am: Yes, but it's probably worth it to get the certificate. Have you seen our online reviews? Most people who complete the certificate program are very satisfied.
M-Au: Yes, I have a friend who got the management certificate through your program. It's really helped her in her career.
W-Am: Well, if you're worried about the cost, you might qualify for a reduced course fee. Would you like me to look into that for you?
