M-Au: Hello, I'm a guest here at the hotel. I plan to do some sightseeing today, and I have a question.
W-Br: Certainly. What can I help you with?
M-Au: I'm interested in visiting a couple of historic neighborhoods. What would be a good way to travel around to see them?
W-Br: Well, you could rent a bicycle. There's a shop just down the street where you can get one.
M-Au: Oh, that's perfect if it's not too expensive.
W-Br: I don't know what they charge, but I'd be happy to call them and find out.
