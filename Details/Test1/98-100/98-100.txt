98-100

M-Au: Hi, Salma. This is Alberto. I'm still out of town training staff at our store in Manila. I'll be here training them until the end of this week. I just remembered that I was supposed to place the order for printer cartridge for our offices, but I forgot to do that. Would you be able to order them? You can find the item number for the printer cartridges on the list on my desk. Oh, one more thing... Can you let me know when you're available next week? We need to start interviewing for a new receptionist when I get back to the office. Thanks.
