W-Am: Rohan, do you have a minute to look at this price list? It's for the newspaper ad for the flower shop. We have to decide how large we want our ad to be.
M-Cn: Sure. Hmm, if we did a full page, we'd have to go with black and white, because color would be too expensive.
W-Am: You're right, but a color ad that shows our flowers will really grab readers' attention.
M-Cn: OK... well, in that case, what if we try a quarter-page ad? We've never used newspaper advertising before, so it'll be a good way to see if it's successful.
