W-Am: Hi, I'm here to pick up a cake for the Frayton Company.
M-Cn: Hmm. I don't see that name here. Maybe the cake was ordered under an individual's name? Uh... I have a Richard...
W-Am: Oh, I'm not sure which of my coworkers ordered it, but it should have the number 25 on it.
M-Cn: Oh, it must be this one.
W-Am: Yeah, that's it. It's for our company's twenty-fifth anniversary celebration tonight. We're very excited.
M-Cn: OK, your total is 40 dollars.

M-Cn: Sorry, we're not set up for that service yet. It's just cash or credit card.
