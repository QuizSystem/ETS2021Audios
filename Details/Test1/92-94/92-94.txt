W-Am: Hi, Omar. This is Anusha from Berringer Media Productions. I'm editing the video you wanted made. And, after reviewing the film, I, uh, I think we should change some of the colors so that the contrast is more noticeable. I went ahead and created a version with the new colors. Now, I know you were hoping to view a draft by this afternoon. But, unfortunately, I'm having some trouble uploading the file. So, I'll call you with an update tomorrow.
