W-Br: Hi. I'm glad all of you could join me at the open house for this apartment today. This is a large one-bedroom apartment with a monthly rent of 800 dollars. OK, let's get started with the tour. The room we're standing in now is the largest room in the apartment. You'll see that it has plenty of light and has been freshly painted. Oh, and before I forget, I have a packet for everyone with more details about the apartment complex. You'll see a lot of useful information about the building rules and facilities.
