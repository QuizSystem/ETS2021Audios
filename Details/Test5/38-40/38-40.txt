W-Am: Hi James and Amal. I wanted to talk to you because Golden International has announced plans to open another location, here in Palmville. The feature attraction at their new amusement park will be the High-Flying Roller Coastertheir fastest ride ever.
W-Br: That's not good news. With a competing park coming to the area, we could have trouble keeping customers.
W-Am: That worries me too. But their target opening date is in two years, so there's time to think of ways to retain customers. We could lower ticket prices.
M-Cn: Hmm, but rides can be a bigger draw than price. Let's talk to Appalachian Incorporated - it's earned a reputation as one of the top roller coaster design firms in the world.
