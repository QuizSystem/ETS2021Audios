W-Br: Hello, this is Maria Krishnan at Krishnan Financial Services. How can I help you?
M-Au: Hi. I need to make some long-termbudgeting decisions for my business, and I’d like to consult with you. Could you meet toward the end of next week?
W-Br: Hm, I'll be at an all-day workshop on Friday, but how about March eleventh? I have a client meeting at two o’clock that day, but I'm available in the morning.
M-Au: Yes, that’s great. Should I bring anything to the appointment besides my recent financial reports?
W-Br: Actually, could you please send those to me ahead of time? That way I'll be able to review the records before we meet.
