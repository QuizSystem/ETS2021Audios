W-Am: As office manager, I've been asked to talk about reducing our expenses here at the office. For example, I worked late last Friday night. And there were a lot of desks with the lamps left on. Honestly, I've done that myself. I think it might help reduce our bill if everyone remembered to turn off the lamps on their desks when leaving the office at the end of the day. On a more positive note, our recycling program has been working very well. So, congratulations for doing such a great job!
