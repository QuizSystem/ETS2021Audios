W-Am: This meeting is to let you know that I've decided to rearrange how the merchandise in the dairy department is displayed. We have to move all the yogurt and milk from the large coolers in the front of the store to the refrigerated shelves in aisle one. Since this will take place during the day when the store is open, we'd like to do it during the shift when the store has the fewest customers. So if you're available during that shift, please sign up to work some extra hours. If we can get this entire move completed within one day, I'll treat our department to a pizza lunch.
