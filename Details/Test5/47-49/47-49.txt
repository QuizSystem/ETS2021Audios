W-Am: Hello, I'm Luisa Reyes. I'm here from the Milston Herald to write about your bookstore.
W-Br: Welcome! We're excited to have the Herald write about us! I'm Maria, the store manager, and this is Omar, the store owner.
M-Au: Hi, Luisa. I'm happy to answer any questions you have. Do you know about the writing workshops weâ€™re conducting next month?

M-Au: Great question. No previous writing experience is needed to attend the workshops.
W-Br: That's right. In fact, we hope new and experienced writers will be able to learn from each other.
