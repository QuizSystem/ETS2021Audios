W-Am Hi, Roger. I have a question about my trip to the conference next month.
M-Au Oh, the one in Chicago? Sure, what is it?
W-Am It’s about booking my flight. I was planning to fly home right after the conference ends. But I noticed that flights for the next day are 400 dollars cheaper.
M-Au Well, you know that might work in our favor. If you stay until the next day, then you could visit Marburn Industriesthey’re one of our top clients in the Chicago area.
W-Am That’d be great. Who at Marburn Industries should I contact to arrange the meeting?
M-Au Janice Shelton – I’ll send you her e-mail address when I get back to my desk.
