M-Cn: Remember, the most important part of being a server is knowing our menu inside and out.
W-Am: Well, I reviewed the entire menu yesterday.
M-Cn: Great, but before we start... let's make sure you remember where all of the tables are. lt looks like there's some food ready for customers. Here's the order ticket. Where should we take it?
