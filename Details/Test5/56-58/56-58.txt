W-Br: Hi, I'm here to see Albert Jenkins, the building project supervisor.
M-Au: That's me. How can I help you?
W-Br: I'm Julie Huang from Monahan Enterprises. I'm here to check on how our new office building is coming along. Would you mind telling me how things are going?

W-Br: So you're ahead of schedule? Well, lâ€™m glad to hear that. I'll meet with the management team later today, so I'll update them on your progress.
