W-Am: First on the agenda, we'll all be attending the Northeast Jewelers Conference in Boston next week. It's just a short train ride from our Boston office, and the company will reimburse you for the ticket. And there's a train station directly in front of the conference center. You are welcome to drive yourself and try to find parking if you'd like. But please remember, it's in a busy part of the city. And I expect everyone to be on time each morning. Also, we'll postpone designing our signature jewelry collection for next season util after we get back.
