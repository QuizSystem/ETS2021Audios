M-Au Hi, Dolores. John’s out sick and hasn’t prepared our team’s progress report for the regional manager. Would you be able to do it?
W-Br Sure, no problem.
M-Au Thanks, I appreciate that. Any chance you could finish it by Friday?
W-Br Hmm… even if I start now, Friday is in two days.
M-Au I understand. Well, I guess early next week would be OK.
W-Br OK. Poor John… I hope he feels better soon. By the way, if he’s currently out, who will participate in the conference call tomorrow?
M-Au I was planning to do that for him.
