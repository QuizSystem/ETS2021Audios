M-Cn: Min-hee, we've begun preparing our first play of the new season. Would you mind double-checking the costume order before I submit it?
W-Am: Sure. Let's see... OK... OK... uh, we don't need that many hats. Half that amount is fine. We can reuse the ones from the spring production.
M-Cn: Alright. I'll lower that. Anything else?
W-Am: No, the rest looks fine. You submit the order, and I'll go install the new ceiling lights now. They're going to hang from the metal brackets we put in above the stage.
M-Cn: Oh, that'll look nice. Brighter is better.
