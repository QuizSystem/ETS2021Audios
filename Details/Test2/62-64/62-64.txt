W-Am: Mr. Stevens, about our new digital camera - you may remember that we asked two consumer focus groups to try it out and tell us what they liked and didn't like. The feedback is in! Take a look.
M-Cn: These are great results! I'm particularly happy that so many people were satisfied with the camera's user manual.
W-Am: So what's the next step? Do we need to get more feedback?
M-Cn: We have plenty of time before the camera launch. Let's have a group of photographers test it. The opinions of actual professionals will help.
