47-49

M-Au: Isabel, I noticed that we're scheduled to give our seminar in the company cafeteria. Isn't the third-floor conference room available?
W-Br: That conference room isn't large enough. Almost 50 people have signed up so far, and we're expecting even more.
M-Au: That's good news, but I listened to a guest speaker in the cafeteria a few weeks ago and I couldn't hear what she was saying. Even with the microphone, the sound just didn't travel well in that room.
W-Br: Now that you mention it, I've had that experience as well. Let me ask the tech department director if he has any suggestions for improving the sound.
