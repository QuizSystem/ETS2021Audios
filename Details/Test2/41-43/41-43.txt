M-Cn: Nancy, I just found out that sales of our new headphones were low this quarter.
W-Br: That's surprising because we just redesigned them.
M-Cn: I have an idea. I've noticed a number of city buses that have large advertisements on them. Maybe we could reach more customers that way. A lot of people will see the advertisements as the buses travel around town.
W-Br: That's a great idea! I'll do some research on how effective this type of advertising is. Then we can decide if we want to invest in it.
