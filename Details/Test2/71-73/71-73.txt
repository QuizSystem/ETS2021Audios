W-Am: Hello everyone, and thank you for joining me this morning. First, I want to make sure you're all aware that our company will begin using a new time-reporting software program next month. This software is an improvement over the one we've been using because it will allow you to more accurately indicate the time you spend on specific projects each day. I invited Michaela from the payroll department here to give a demonstration. She'll explain how to report your time using this new system. Welcome, Michaela!
