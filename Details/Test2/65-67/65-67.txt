M-Au: I'm glad you had time to talk today, Angela. We're meeting with the executive board next week and we need to discuss this report on production costs.
W-Br: Yes, I was concerned when I saw the report, too.
M-Au: Well, the board's main concern will be about the cost of producing our hand cream. Look at the current production cost for that. We used to be able to produce it for much less.
W-Br: I know. But the factory that produces the cream has been having problems with their machinery. That's slowing down production and could be increasing the cost to produce each unit.
M-Au: Let's take a drive out there tomorrow to get more information.
