W-Br: Good morning. I'd like to check out - I was in room 205. Here's my room key.
M-Cn: Certainly. I'll just print out a copy of the charges that'll be billed to your credit card... All right, here it is. I hope you enjoyed your stay.
W-Br: Yes - it was great to have a room right in the downtown area. Oh wait, I didn't order any room service last night, but there's a charge for it here.
M-Cn: I'm very sorry about that. I can fix that and print a new bill for you.
W-Br: Actually, I need to get to the airport. My flight leaves in an hour. Can you e-mail it to me?
M-Cn: Absolutely. Have a good flight.
