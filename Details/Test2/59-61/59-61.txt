W-Am: Liam, the representatives from Pronote International will be here at two.
M-Au: Right. They're looking for a caterer, and I'm sure once they sample our food they'll want to hire us. Theresa put together a great menu. And... I think we're ready to start preparing the food for the tasting.
W-Am: Theresa isn't here!
M-Au: Oh, she called to say she'd be a little late. It's fine. We have plenty of time. I could coconut curry dish we're planning.
W-Am: I thought that was a beef dish.
M-Au: It usually is, but the rep from Pronote made a special request for the demonstration. It'll still be a showcase dish.
